| `read`         | -       | `i32`   | Reads single input from standard input                                                                        |

| `writeln`      | `i32`   | -       | Writes single integer to standard output with a newline character afterwards                                  |
| `writeChar`    | `i32`   | -       | Writes single integer converted into a utf-8 character to standard output                                     |
| `writeCharLn`  | `i32`   | -       | Writes single integer converted into a utf-8 character to standard output with a newline character afterwards |
