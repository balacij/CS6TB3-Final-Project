# Group 8 - Disjoint Union Types

## Objective
Adding Disjoint Union Types to P0

## Proposal

If you would like to view my proposal for implementing Disjoint Union Types into P0, please see <a href="proposal/PROPOSAL_DUT.md">`proposal/PROPOSAL_DUT.md`</a>. Please note that I was previously considering working on a partial evaluation project but I have since decided to continue through with the disjoint unions project.
