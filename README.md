Adding Disjoint Union Types to P0

I am currently deciding between Disjoint Union Types and a partial evaluator project. I've built a proposal for both projects.

Please see PROPOSAL_DUT.md for the disjoint union types project (for which I am currently registered to be working on), but please also have a look PROPOSAL_PE.md for the Partial Evaluator project for which I am also considering.
