# Group 8

## Objective
Adding Disjoint Union Types to P0

If you would like to view my proposal for implementing Disjoint Union Types into P0, please see `proposal/PROPOSAL_PE.md`. Please note that I was previously considering working on a partial evaluation project but I have since decided to continue through with the disjoint unions project.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
You will need to have a working installation of:
* Python 3.7+
* `pip`
* `virtualenv`

### Setup environment
Please carefully read and follow these instructions:
1. Move into the `src` directory<br>`cd src`
2. Open up a new Python virtual environment if you haven't already created one for the project.<br>`virtualenv -v .venv/`
3. Open up the virtual environment.<br>`source .venv/bin/activate`
4. If you haven't previously installed the project required libraries, please do so using:<br>`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run
Before running, please ensure that your environment is in working order.
