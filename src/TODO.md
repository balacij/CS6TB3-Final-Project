# TODOs
1. Fill out examples
2. Clean up program entry -- get a nice `getopts` Python setup going
3. Allow procedures to be called and returned as values in expressions (no LARROW) if they have a single return value
4. Create `is<Kind>` functions automatically?
5. Add parsing tests (though I realistically already did them, just need to re-write them again...)
6. Create presentation
7. `grep -E "TODO" -r *` -- go through all file TODOs and handle them accordingly
